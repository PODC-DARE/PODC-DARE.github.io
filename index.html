    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p>The main goal of the workshop is to create a platform for the exchange of tools,  ideas,  and  questions  between  researchers  working  on  different  aspects  of real  networks.
    Especially the concepts from the quite young area of sparse graphs and from network science are not widely known in the distributed community. <br>
    We hope that the workshop will foster new cross-field collaborations that will lead to strongnew results. In particular we hope that the workshop will encourage more practical works such as implementation, evaluation, and the usage of structural graph theory in larger systems. On the other hand we expect that researchers working on practical problems (both on physical and social networks) can show possible new directions for theoretical researches that are relevant for practical applications</p>

        Disconnected cooperation in resilient networks <br> and the algorithmic challenges of local fast re-routing

            The dependability of distributed systems often critically depends on the underlying communication network, realized by a set of routers. To provide high availability, modern routers support local fast rerouting of flows: routers can be preconfigured with conditional failover rules which define to which port a packet arriving on this incoming port should be forwarded deterministically depending on the status of the incident links only. As routers need to react quickly, they do not have time to learn about remote failures.<br>
            My talk revolves around the fundamental question whether and how local fast rerouting mechanisms can be configured such that packets always reach their destination even in the presence of multiple failures, as long as the underlying network is still connected. I will show that this algorithmic problem is related to the field of disconnected cooperation, and offers a number of challenging research questions -- and sometimes surprising results.
            In particular, I will give an overview of state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques for different realistic graph classes (from dense datacenter topologies to sparse wide-area networks) and discuss lower bounds and impossibility results. While the main focus of the talk will be on deterministic algorithms, we will also take a glimpse at the power of randomization.

            Data centers are one of the most important settings in modern computer networking and distributed computing.  Due to their importance they are very carefully architected, including the physical topology.  While some distributed algorithms can be used "off the shelf" in data centers, the importance of performance and reliability, together with the carefully designed topologies, mean that it is often necessary to tailor our algorithms to the specifics of data center topologies.  In this talk I will give an overview of data center topologies, with a focus on proposed next-generation "expander data centers" based on expander graphs.  This will hopefully help the distributed algorithms community more easily contribute to the field of data center networking.

        Locality and the Stochastic Matching Problem

            In the stochastic matching problem, we are given an arbitrary graph G, and the goal is to find a matching of an unknown random subgraph G' of G by querying only a small number of edges in G. In this talk, we show how with the machinery of distributed local algorithms, one can analyze a (non-distributed and global) Monte Carlo algorithm for the stochastic matching problem and prove that it obtains an almost maximum size matching with very few queries.<br>
